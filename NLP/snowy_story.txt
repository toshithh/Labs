The Little Penguin and the Snowman

One winter day, a little penguin named Pippa was feeling lonely. She had no friends to play with, and her parents were busy fishing. She decided to explore the snowy land around her, hoping to find something fun to do.

She waddled across the ice, sliding and slipping along the way. She saw some seals sunbathing on a rock, but they ignored her. She saw some polar bears wrestling in the snow, but they scared her. She saw some snowflakes falling from the sky, but they melted on her feathers.

She felt sad and bored, until she spotted something in the distance. It was a big, round, white thing, with a smaller, round, white thing on top of it. It had two black dots for eyes, a carrot for a nose, and a smile made of pebbles. It was wearing a hat and a scarf, and it had two sticks for arms.

Pippa was curious. She approached the thing and said, "Hello, who are you?"

The thing did not answer. It just smiled.

Pippa touched it with her flipper. It was cold and hard. She realized it was made of snow.

"You're a snowman!" she exclaimed. "Do you want to be my friend?"

The snowman did not answer. It just smiled.

Pippa decided that the snowman was her friend. She named him Snowy. She told him all about herself, her family, and her dreams. She asked him questions, but he did not reply. She did not mind. She liked his smile.

She played with him, making snow angels, throwing snowballs, and sliding down hills. She had so much fun, she forgot about her loneliness.

She decided to share her fish with him, but he did not eat. She decided to give him a hug, but he did not hug back. She decided to tell him a joke, but he did not laugh. She did not mind. She liked his smile.

She spent the whole day with him, until the sun began to set. She realized she had to go home. She said goodbye to him, and promised to come back the next day. She thanked him for being her friend.

The snowman did not answer. He just smiled.

Pippa left, feeling happy and warm. She looked forward to seeing him again.

The next day, she woke up early and ran to the spot where she had left him. But when she got there, she saw something that made her heart sink.

The snowman was gone.

There was only a pile of snow, a hat, a scarf, a carrot, some pebbles, and some sticks.

Pippa was confused. She wondered what had happened to him. She looked around, hoping to find him somewhere.

She saw some footprints in the snow, leading away from the pile. She followed them, hoping they would lead her to him.

She followed them for a long time, until she reached the edge of the ice. There, she saw something that made her heart soar.

The snowman was there.

He was standing on a small iceberg, floating in the water. He had two black dots for eyes, a carrot for a nose, and a smile made of pebbles. He was wearing a hat and a scarf, and he had two sticks for arms.

He was still smiling.

Pippa was overjoyed. She called out to him, "Snowy, you're here! I'm so happy to see you!"

The snowman did not answer. He just smiled.

Pippa wanted to join him, but she knew she could not swim. She asked him to come back, but he did not move. She begged him to stay, but he did not listen.

She did not understand. She wondered why he had left her. She wondered if he still wanted to be her friend.

She felt sad and angry. She cried out to him, "Snowy, why did you leave me? Don't you like me? Don't you want to be my friend?"

The snowman did not answer. He just smiled.

Pippa felt hurt and betrayed. She turned away from him, and ran back to her home. She did not look back.

She decided that the snowman was not her friend. She decided that he was mean and selfish. She decided that she hated him.

She decided that she would never see him again.

She spent the rest of the day in her igloo, feeling lonely and cold. She did not talk to anyone, not even her parents. She did not eat, not even her fish. She did not play, not even with her toys.

She did not smile, not even once.

She went to bed early, hoping to forget about him. She closed her eyes, and tried to sleep.

But she could not sleep.

She kept thinking about him, his smile, and their time together. She remembered how he had made her happy, how he had listened to her, how he had played with her.

She realized that he was not mean and selfish. He was kind and gentle. He was not a thing. He was a friend.

She realized that she missed him. She realized that she loved him.

She realized that she had made a mistake.

She got up from her bed, and ran out of her igloo. She ran to the spot where she had last seen him. She hoped that he was still there. She hoped that he would forgive her.

She reached the edge of the ice, and looked at the water.

But he was not there.

The iceberg was gone.

The snowman was gone.

There was only water, and sky, and stars.

Pippa was devastated. She knew that he was gone forever. She knew that she would never see him again.

She fell to her knees, and sobbed. She cried out to him, "Snowy, I'm sorry! I'm sorry for being mean to you! I'm sorry for leaving you! I'm sorry for not understanding you!"

She cried out to him, "Snowy, I love you! I love you more than anything! I love you more than fish, more than snow, more than myself!"

She cried out to him, "Snowy, please come back! Please come back to me! Please be my friend!"

She cried out to him, but he did not answer.

He did not smile.

He did not come back.

He was gone.

Pippa cried until she had no tears left. She cried until she felt numb. She cried until she fell asleep.

She slept on the ice, under the stars.

She dreamed of him, his smile, and their time together.

She dreamed of him, and he dreamed of her.

They dreamed of each other, and they were happy.

They were friends.

The End
