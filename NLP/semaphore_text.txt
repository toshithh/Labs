Semaphore: A Semaphore is a lock type that allows a fixed number of threads to access a shared resource concurrently. It maintains a counter that limits the number of threads allowed to acquire the lock. Once the limit is reached, subsequent threads are blocked until a thread releases the lock. This lock type is useful in scenarios where you want to control the level of concurrency. The Semaphore class in Kotlin provides the necessary functions acquire() and release() for acquiring and releasing the lock, respectively.
